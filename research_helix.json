This NIH-funded COVID-19 testing lab is operated by Helix, a genomics company in San Mateo, California, that quietly helped the CDC identify a significant portion of the Alpha variant, also known as B.1.1.7, this past winter. Though Helix was initially a \"reluctant participant\" in coronavirus testing, CEO James Lu said, the company's trajectory during the pandemic mirrored that of the biotech industry's contributions to fight the virus as a whole. By midfall, Helix had secured more lab space and quadrupled in size, with contract staff working around the clock to process tests, said Vice President Marc Laurent, who oversees operations in San Diego. Reflecting on the past 15 months — from working on one of the first FDA-approved coronavirus tests to scaling up production amid pandemic supply constraints to tracking variants over the past winter — Lu said he's most proud of how quickly the Helix team has moved.","score":0.6058229,"raw_content":null}],"response_time":1.4,"request_id":"4a03d144-5211-4a3a-84a9-efd824d794a2"}
