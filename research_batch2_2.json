But when I got to Merck—wow,” Li said. I think a few months into Merck, I was very sure that, yeah, this is where I belong,” Li said. At Merck, they had called this “cross fertilization,” Li said. AbbVie was interested in ADARx for its technology, not just as a one-off asset, Li said. The bigger company also brought its antibody technology to the mix, which was a piece missing from ADARx. Li said they had been talking about how to add that capability to boost the siRNA technology, so the partnership was a perfect fit. Li leads with results, the science and the technology, taking a lesson from Merck’s legendary founder, George Merck, who famously said: “We try to remember that medicine is for the patient. We literally turned down $200 million,” Li said.","score":0.73505294,"raw_content":null},{"url":"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adarx-pharmaceuticals-announces-positive-interim-160000770.html","title":"ADARx Pharmaceuticals Announces Positive Interim Phase 1 ...","content":"(ADARx), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company developing next-generation RNA therapeutics, today announced positive interim Phase 1 data for ADX-038, an investigational small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic candidate that targets complement factor B (CFB). ADX-038 is being developed to treat multiple diseases that are driven by activation of the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement system, including renal diseases (immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G)). The data presented at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2025 demonstrated that a single subcutaneous dose of ADX-038 was well tolerated and led to deep and sustained reduction of circulating plasma CFB protein levels, which resulted in selective and maximal suppression of complement AP activity without changes in the complement system classical pathway (CP) activity. The positive Phase 1 data could support a differentiated therapeutic profile for ADX-038 with regards to both the duration and depth of AP activity inhibition in treating complement-mediated diseases.","score":0.7045877,"raw_content":null},{"url":"https://www.adarx.com/adarx-pharmaceuticals-announces-positive-interim-phase-1-clinical-data-for-its-novel-sirna-targeting-complement-factor-b-cfb/","title":"News - ADARx Pharmaceuticals","content":"ADARx is focused on advancing and expanding a deep pipeline of highly potent, durable and selective RNA-targeted therapeutic candidates,","score":0.68064564,"raw_content":null},{"url":"https://news.abbvie.com/2025-05-14-AbbVie-and-ADARx-Pharmaceuticals-Announce-Collaboration-and-License-Option-Agreement-to-Develop-Next-Generation-siRNA-Therapies-Across-Multiple-Therapeutic-Areas","title":"AbbVie and ADARx Pharmaceuticals Announce Collaboration and ...","content":"AbbVie and ADARx Pharmaceuticals Announce Collaboration and License Option Agreement to Develop Next-Generation siRNA Therapies Across Multiple Therapeutic Areas. -        *Collaboration to leverage AbbVie's expertise in biotherapeutic drug development* *and commercialization together with ADARx's proprietary RNA technology to advance next-generation siRNA therapies across neuroscience, immunology and oncology*.
