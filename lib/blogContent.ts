## What is Nearshoring?

Nearshoring is the practice of relocating manufacturing or business operations to a nearby country, rather than a distant one. For US companies, Mexico—particularly Tijuana—has become the premier nearshoring destination.

Unlike offshoring to Asia, nearshoring to Tijuana offers:
- **Same-day logistics** to California markets
- **Time zone alignment** with US headquarters
- **Cultural proximity** and bilingual workforce
- **USMCA trade benefits** for duty-free movement of goods

## Why Tijuana?

Tijuana has emerged as Mexico's manufacturing powerhouse for several compelling reasons:

### Strategic Location
Located just 20 minutes from San Diego, Tijuana provides immediate access to the world's busiest land border crossing. This proximity translates to reduced shipping costs and faster time-to-market.

### Skilled Workforce
With over 700,000 workers in the manufacturing sector, Tijuana offers a deep talent pool trained in precision manufacturing. Industries like medical devices and aerospace have decades of heritage here.

### Established Infrastructure
Over 70 million square feet of industrial inventory, with Class A buildings available for immediate occupancy. Major industrial parks include El Florido, Otay, and Pacifico.

## Getting Started

The fastest path to production in Tijuana is through a shelter service, which handles all legal, HR, and compliance requirements while you focus on manufacturing. Most companies are operational within 90 days.

### Key Steps:
1. Define your space and labor requirements
2. Tour industrial parks with a local partner
3. Select a shelter provider or establish your own entity
4. Hire and train your workforce
5. Begin production

## The True Cost of Manufacturing

When comparing manufacturing locations, many companies focus solely on labor rates. But the true cost picture involves much more: logistics, duties, inventory carrying costs, quality issues, and IP protection.

## Labor Cost Comparison

| Factor | China | Vietnam | Tijuana |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| Hourly Wage | $6-8 | $3-4 | $4-6 |
| Benefits/Overhead | +40% | +35% | +45% |
| Productivity | 100% | 85% | 95% |

While China and Vietnam may show lower hourly wages, productivity differences and overhead costs narrow the gap significantly.

## Total Landed Cost Analysis

For a typical US-bound shipment:

### From China:
- Ocean freight: 3-4 weeks
- Tariffs: 7.5-25% (depending on product)
- Inventory carrying cost: 6-8 weeks of stock
- Total logistics add: 15-25% of product cost

### From Tijuana:
- Truck freight: Same-day to 2 days
- Tariffs: 0% (USMCA qualified)
- Inventory carrying cost: 1-2 weeks of stock
- Total logistics add: 3-5% of product cost

## The Bottom Line

For most products shipped to the US market, Tijuana offers 15-30% lower total landed cost compared to Asian alternatives, even when labor rates are slightly higher.

## Beyond Cost: Speed and Flexibility

The proximity advantage goes beyond cost savings:
- **Faster time-to-market** for new products
- **Reduced minimum order quantities**
- **Easier collaboration** with same-timezone engineering teams
- **Better IP protection** under USMCA

## What is a Shelter Service?

A shelter service (or "albergue" in Spanish) is a Mexican entity that allows foreign companies to manufacture in Mexico without establishing their own legal presence. The shelter company acts as the legal employer and handles all administrative, legal, and compliance requirements.

## How It Works

### The Shelter Company Handles:
- **Legal entity and permits** - IMMEX registration, import/export licenses
- **Human resources** - Hiring, payroll, benefits, labor relations
- **Compliance** - Tax filings, IMSS, INFONAVIT, environmental permits
- **Customs** - Import/export of raw materials and finished goods
- **Real estate** - Facility leasing and management

### You Retain Control Of:
- **Production** - Your processes, your way
- **Quality** - Your standards and certifications
- **Intellectual property** - Your designs and trade secrets
- **Equipment** - Temporarily imported under your control
- **Management** - Your supervisors run the floor

## Timeline to Production

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Site selection | 2-4 weeks |
| Shelter contract | 1-2 weeks |
| Facility setup | 4-8 weeks |
| Hiring & training | 2-4 weeks |
| **Total** | **9-18 weeks** |

Compare this to 12-24 months for establishing your own Mexican entity.

## Cost Structure

Shelter services typically charge:
- **Per-employee fee**: $150-300/month per direct labor employee
- **Administrative percentage**: 3-5% of payroll
- **One-time setup fee**: $10,000-25,000

## Is Shelter Right for You?

Shelter is ideal if:
- You're new to Mexico manufacturing
- You want speed-to-market
- Your headcount is under 500 employees
- You want to test the market before committing

As you scale, you can transition to your own entity (a process called "graduation") while retaining the same workforce and facility.
