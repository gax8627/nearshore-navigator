| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |

## 2. Competitive Advantage

- **Multi-lingual Authority**: By ranking for "섹션 321" (KR) and "Section 321 大师指南" (ZH), we capture a niche that US-only 3PLs ignore.
- **Agent-Driven Data**: The "Real-Time Market Pulse" on our insights page provides the "Freshness" signal Google loves.
- **Internal Linking**: The high-authority `Distribution Centers` page now passes 'link juice' directly to the guide.

## 3. Estimated Time to Rank

- **Top 50**: 2–4 weeks (after sitemap re-indexing).
- **Top 10**: 3–5 months (requires 5–10 high-quality external backlinks).
- **Global Markets (KR/ZH/JP)**: 1–2 months (lower competition in localized search).

## 4. Final Verdict

The page is now **technically perfect** for ranking. Its success now depends on **backlink building** and social sharing of the MRA data insights.

## 5. Competitor Deep-Dive & Regulatory Pivot

### The Competitors

- **Ship321**: Strong brand-keyword match, but heavily reliant on now-suspended 'Duty-Free' messaging.
- **G-Global**: Great technical infrastructure, but lacks localized Asian SEO (KR/ZH).
- **Mochila**: Best UI/UX, but content is 'Generalist' rather than 'Executive Guidance.'

### The 'Attack' Strategy (Phase 5)

1. **Regulatory News-Jacking**: By updating our guide to focus on the **Aug 2025 de minimis suspension**, we will outrank competitors who are stuck in the 2024 'Duty-Free' paradigm.
2. **Alternative Routing Focus**: Focus keywords on **"IMMEX vs Section 321 2026"** and **"Border Bonded Warehousing."**
3. **Asian Capital Capture**: Naver and Baidu SEO is our 'blue ocean' where we have zero competition from Tijuana 3PLs.
